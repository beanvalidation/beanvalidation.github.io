      Recently we have been discussing whether any new constraints should be added to the specification or not.
      Traditionally, Bean Validation stayed on the conservative side of things in this regard.
      It defined only some generically applicable and widely useful constraints in the specification itself, e.g. @NotNull, @Size or @Pattern.

      &lt;p&gt;The work on Bean Validation 2.0 is in full swing and there is an issue where we could benefit from your help.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Recently we have been discussing whether any new constraints &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/beanvalidation-dev/2016-August/001000.html&quot;&gt;should be added&lt;/a&gt; to the specification or not.
      Traditionally, Bean Validation stayed on the conservative side of things in this regard.
      It defined only some generically applicable and widely useful constraints in the specification itself, e.g. &lt;code&gt;@NotNull&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@Size&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;@Pattern&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Now Marco Molteni did a very interesting analysis on the constraints which are actually used in real world projects by &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/beanvalidation-dev/2016-August/001000.html&quot;&gt;running an analysis&lt;/a&gt; of open source projects hosted on GitHub.
      Only a specific type of project is hosted there usually (mostly libraries, as opposed to actual end user facing applications),
      so the numbers should be taken with a grain of salt. But nevertheless they are very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Marco's analysis shows that besides the BV-defined constraints &lt;code&gt;@NotEmpty&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@NotBlank&lt;/code&gt; - both defined by the reference implementation Hibernate validator - are very frequently used and thus are potential candidates for inclusion into Bean Validation 2.0.
      The former asserts that the annotated string, collection, map or array is neither null nor empty, the latter validates that the annotated string is neither null nor empty, stripping leading/trailing whitespace.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Another candidate may be &lt;code&gt;@Email&lt;/code&gt;; but validation of e-mail addresses is a surprisingly complex business, with different people having different ideas and expectations of how a valid (or invalid) e-mail address should look like (take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Examples&quot;&gt;examples on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; to get an idea).
      Hence I feel this is not something we should aim for in the specification.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;To add some further data points, we created the following survey on constraints to be added potentially.
      Getting back many answers to this poll will help us to form a better understanding of what you, the users out there, really need.
      If you would like to see support for other constraints not mentioned in the survey, you can add them via the free-text field in the last question.
      These may be custom constraints defined by a Bean Validation provider, a third-party library or in your own projects which you see yourself using very frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Taking the survey will take you only a minute, so give it a go. Thanks a lot for your help!&lt;/p&gt;

      Today I've got some great news to share with you: a new revision of the Bean Validation spec is about to be kicked off!
      
      Over the last weeks, we've been busy with preparing a proposal for this JSR and I've submitted it to the JCP (Java Community Process) last week.
      You can find the proposal for "JSR 380: Bean Validation 2.0" on jcp.org.

      &lt;p&gt;Today I've got some great news to share with you: a new revision of the Bean Validation spec is about to be kicked off!&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Over the last weeks, we've been busy with preparing a proposal for this JSR and I've submitted it to the JCP (Java Community Process) last week.
      You can find the proposal for &quot;JSR 380: Bean Validation 2.0&quot; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=380&quot;&gt;jcp.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;In the following, let's take a look at what we think should be part of Bean Validation 2.0 and what we've planned as the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;Looking back...&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Bean Validation 1.0 and 1.1 (JSRs 303/349) saw a huge adoption by the Java community and are integrated with a wide range of technologies, be it other Java standards (e.g. CDI, JPA, JAX-RS)
      or 3rd party libraries and frameworks such as Spring, Vaadin and many, many more.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;The main contribution of Bean Validation 1.1 - the declarative validation of method-level constraints - has been integrated into techs such as CDI and Spring,
      making it a breeze to write expressive API contracts with constraints which are automatically validated upon execution.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Bean Validation 1.1 has been finalized &lt;a href=&quot;http://beanvalidation.org/news/2013/05/02/bean-validation-1-1-is-a-spec/&quot;&gt;three years ago&lt;/a&gt; and Java continued to evolve since then.
      Java 8 - released in 2014 - brings many very interesting language features to the table, but also adds a new time and date API and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;...and forward&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;So it's about time that Bean Validation supports new JDK types such as &lt;code&gt;LocalTime&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt;, but also takes advantage of new (language) features such as type annotations, repeatable annotations, reflective parameter name retrieval, lambda expressions etc.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;To give just one example, let's consider the requirement of applying constraints to the elements of a specific collection.
      This has been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/BVAL-202&quot;&gt;long-standing feature request&lt;/a&gt;, but we could never find a way to solve it generically in an acceptable manner.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Java 8 finally provides the perfect tool to solve this issue: &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/type_annotations.html&quot;&gt;type annotations&lt;/a&gt;.
      Annotating type parameters of collections is a very intuitive way to apply constraints to collection elements (and not the entire collection itself):&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;@Email String&amp;gt; emails;
      &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Java 8 provides the required APIs to retrieve the constraint annotation from the type parameter and apply the validation accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;But it doesn't stop there.
      Repeatable annotation types will make it less verbose to specify several constraints of the same type one and the same element.
      Reflective parameter name retrieval will provide better validation messages out of the box when validating constraints on method parameters.
      Lambda expressions might be a useful vehicle to express small ad-hoc validation routines.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;What else?&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;While we envision supporting and leveraging Java 8 as the &quot;main theme&quot; of Bean Validation 2.0, we hope to address some other issues, too.
      E.g. there may be support for more customized payloads of constraint violations.
      Also a builder API for constraint violation exceptions might be useful.
      As would an API for validating an object graph assuming a list of changes to be applied.
      Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=380&quot;&gt;JSR 380 proposal&lt;/a&gt; for some more ideas we have.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;While the baseline for Bean Validation 2.0 will be Java 8, we'll also be tracking the ongoing work for Java 9 and work towards making Bean Validation ready for Java 9 and its module system as far as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;As the time-line of Bean Validation 2.0 is quite compact, we are very eager to hear from you, the community of users, and learn what would be the things most useful to you.
      For sure we won't be able to address all potential ideas out there. So if there are features close to your heart which you'd really love to see in the spec, be sure to speak up and let us know.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;As per &lt;a href=&quot;https://jcp.org/en/procedures/jcp2#3.3&quot;&gt;the rules&lt;/a&gt; of the Java Community Process, the Bean Validation 2.0 JSR is currently up for review by the JCP executive committee.
      After that, there will be an approval ballot and we will hopefully be ready to go and kick off the work on actual spec changes, prototyping new features in the reference implementation and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;So if you ever wanted to contribute to a Java Specification Request - be it just by voting for issues, opening new feature requests or actually working on the specification, its reference implementation and the test compatability kit (TCK) - then this is the perfect time.
      If you are a member of the JCP, you also can &lt;a href=&quot;https://jcp.org/en/jsr/egnom?id=380&quot;&gt;join the expert group&lt;/a&gt;, we'd be very happy to have you aboard.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Whether EG member or not, in order to get the discussion on this JSR proposal started, just drop a comment below, post to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.hibernate.org/viewforum.php?f=26&quot;&gt;feedback forum&lt;/a&gt;, shoot a message to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/beanvalidation-dev&quot;&gt;Bean Validation mailing list&lt;/a&gt; or
      comment on specific issues in &lt;a href=&quot;https://hibernate.atlassian.net/projects/BVAL/summary&quot;&gt;the tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;We are looking forward to hearing from you and get Bean Validation 2.0 rolling!&lt;/p&gt;

      Exactly one year after the last maintenance release we've published version 1.1.4.Final of the Bean Validation TCK today.
      It contains exactly one issue, BVTCK-68,
      which is about the removal of two tests from the TCK which could not be tested in a portable manner across containers.
      Check out the issue itself for the complete story.
      
      As always, the new TCK version is available for download as TAR.GZ and ZIP on SourceForge.
      Alternatively you can obtain the test suite via Maven, Gradle etc. using the coordinates org.hibernate.beanvalidation.tck:beanvalidation-tck-tests:1.1.4.Final.

      Good news for those of you who want to certify the compatibility of a Bean Validation
      implementation (and its API JAR) against Java SE 8.
      
      We have released updates to the Bean Validation TCK 1.0 and 1.1;
      The versions are 1.0.7.GA and 1.1.3.Final, respectively.
      Both TCK releases come now with a version of the API signature file which works with Java SE 8.
      This signature file can be used to assert API compatibility with JSR 303/349 via
      the SigTest tool.
      SigTest 3.0 needs to be used from now on. Note that the actual tests of the TCKs remain unchanged.

      Antonio Goncalves, fellow JCP member and friend has asked
      me
      why Bean Validation XML's namespace has not moved from its original location to
      the jcp.org location like other Java EE 7 specifications.
      
      I don't remember being aware that such a move was orchestrated so there are two

      &lt;p&gt;Antonio Goncalves, fellow JCP member and friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://antoniogoncalves.org/2013/06/04/java-ee-7-deployment-descriptors/&quot;&gt;has asked
      me&lt;/a&gt;
      why Bean Validation XML's namespace has not moved from its original location to
      the jcp.org location like other Java EE 7 specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;I don't remember being aware that such a move was orchestrated so there are two
      possible reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I was never been made aware of the move,&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I was aware of it but considered that it was low priority compared to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hibernate.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20BVAL%20AND%20fixVersion%20in%20(%221.1.0.Alpha1%20(early%20draft%201)%22%2C%20%221.1.0.Beta1%20(public%20draft%201)%22%2C%20%221.1.0.Beta2%22%2C%20%221.1.0.Beta3%22%2C%20%221.1.0.Beta4%22%2C%20%221.1.0.CR1%22%2C%20%221.1.0.CR2%22%2C%20%221.1.0.CR3%22%2C%20%221.1.0.Final%22)%20AND%20status%20in%20(Resolved%2C%20Closed)&quot;&gt;other
      issues&lt;/a&gt; we were working on.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ol&gt;
      
      
      &lt;p&gt;Provided we had to work hard till the last minute, and that the community never
      was keen on the XML support we put in Bean Validation, #2 is not impossible but
      I suspect it's #1 or I would have opened an issue to track the task.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Anyways, that's not a problem. Anyone can open an issue (I've just &lt;a href=&quot;https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/BVAL-455&quot;&gt;created
      one&lt;/a&gt; for this task), write a
      couple of pull requests to fix the spec, TCK and RI as explained in &lt;a href=&quot;http://beanvalidation.org/contribute/&quot;&gt;our
      contribute section&lt;/a&gt;. Scratch your own itch: so who's jumping? :)&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;We will have to wait for the next version of the spec to avoid breaking older
      applications but if it's committed, it won't be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;PS: no, I'm not bitter, but since I haven't blogged in a while that was a good
      occasion to remind everyone of the power of contributions ;)&lt;/p&gt;

      It's now official, these couple of years of work have made it into an
      official JCP specification.
      Bean Validation is also part of Java EE 7 which has
      been approved too
      a few of days ago.
      
      We have already discussed the features at great length here but to do a short
      summary:
      
      
      support for method and constructor validation (via CDI, JAX-RS etc)
      integration with CDI (Validator and ValidatorFactory injectable,
      ConstraintValidator instances being CDI beans and thus accept @Inject,
      etc)
      EL expressions based error messages
      group conversion in object graphs

      Our Proposed Final Draft has been officially handed over to the JCP last night.
      
      After a frantic month of work culminating with two weeks of monomaniac focus, we
      are finally handing over the Bean Validation 1.1 Proposed Final Draft to the
      JCP. Of course everything is open source so you can get it too:
      
      
      the spec
      the JavaDoc

      What's new in Bean Validation 1.1?

      &lt;h2&gt;What's different between Beta 4 and CR 1?&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;We did a lot of polishing and nailed a lot of remaining corner cases. Here is a
      few of the tasks we worked on:&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;rework of the JavaDoc&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;move to &lt;code&gt;@SupportValidationTarget&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;ConstraintValidator&lt;/code&gt; instead of the
      additional &lt;code&gt;@CrossParameterConstraint&lt;/code&gt; on the constraint to mark a constraint
      as cross-parameter&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;many more examples in the specification&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;improve node creation logic when nodes are added programmatically&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;improve the creation logic of custom nodes when using the programmatic API of
      &lt;code&gt;ConstraintViolationBuilder&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;ConstraintValidator&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      
      
      &lt;p&gt;And of course many hours rereading the specification to find holes and fix them.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;Review&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Hibernate Validator 5.0.0.CR1 and the TCK should be here any minute. Help us
      make this spec as good as possible by reviewing it and opening issues where it
      itches you.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://beanvalidation.org/1.1/spec/1.1.0.cr1/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_content=spec&amp;amp;utm_campaign=1_1_cr1&quot;&gt;access the specification here&lt;/a&gt;.
      All changes are marked with a different
      color. &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#DDFFDD;&quot;&gt;Green for additions&lt;/span&gt;,
      &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#FFFFDD;&quot;&gt;yellow for changes&lt;/span&gt;.
      This will help you see what has changed precisely.&lt;/p&gt;

      Our proposed final draft is due soon but we did one last drop of the
      specification and the API jar. We worked all over the board (and the
      clock) but the most notable improvements are:
      
      Improvements on the CDI integration section
      
      We made it much more descriptive of the expected behavior instead of
      imposing an implementation pattern.
      We have also added the method and constructor interception priority
      as defined in the Java EE specification and the interceptor specification
      in particular.
      
      Thanks Pete for your help.

      &lt;h2&gt;Remove the link between the Node API and the metadata API&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;This is something we could not make work, so we fall back into a more
      redundant but we think cleaner design. We also made the node builder
      API easier to use despite the increased number of node types.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//Cross-parameter constraint on a method
      //mergeAddresses(Map&amp;lt;String,Address&amp;gt; addresses, Map&amp;lt;String,Address&amp;gt; otherAddresses)
      //Build a constraint violation on the default path + &quot;otherAddresses[&quot;home&quot;]
      //ie. the Address bean hosted in the &quot;home&quot; key of the &quot;otherAddresses&quot; map parameter
      context.buildConstraintViolationWithTemplate(
              &quot;Map entry home present in both and does not match&quot;)
                      .addParameterNode(1)
                      .addBeanNode()
                          .inIterable().atKey(&quot;home&quot;)
                      .addConstraintViolation();
      &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;Clarification around method validation (metadata, cross-parameter, reports)&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;We now have an explicit cross-parameter concept materialized in the metadata
      API. It makes for a more regular and easier to browse API.
      &lt;code&gt;ConstraintViolation&lt;/code&gt; has also seen some improvements and adaptations to make
      it ready for prime - method validation - time.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;Mark a method as (non) validated&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;We slightly improved &lt;code&gt;@ValidateExecutable&lt;/code&gt; to be more friendly when
      put on a specific method. To force a getter to be validated or to
      force a method to not be validated is now more readable.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Operations {
          @ValidateExecutable
          @Status
          public String getStatus() { ... }
      
          @ValidateExecutable(ExecutableType.NONE)
          public void apply(@Valid Operation operation) { ... }
      }
      &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;Review&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Let us know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://beanvalidation.org/1.1/spec/1.1.0.beta4/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_content=spec&amp;amp;utm_campaign=1_1_beta4&quot;&gt;access the specification here&lt;/a&gt;.
      All changes are marked with a different

      With two months since the last release and more than 38 (non trivial)
      issues behind us, we felt that it was a good time to release a new version.
      We are less than 20 days from the proposed final draft so feedback time and
      polishing are going into overdrive.
      
      Expect a reference implementation and a much improved TCK aligned with this
      version in the next few days.
      
      What's new
      
      There are too many improvements so let's pick three.
      
      Enable / disable method validation
      
      We worked a lot on method validation and in particular how you can control
      whether or not a method or constructor is being validated. You can use

      &lt;p&gt;With two months since the last release and more than 38 (non trivial)

      &lt;p&gt;There are too many improvements so let's pick three.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h3&gt;Enable / disable method validation&lt;/h3&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;We worked a lot on method validation and in particular how you can control
      whether or not a method or constructor is being validated. You can use
      &lt;code&gt;@ValidateExecutable&lt;/code&gt; and the XML &lt;code&gt;validated-executables&lt;/code&gt; element in
      &lt;code&gt;validation.xml&lt;/code&gt; to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h3&gt;Message interpolation with UEL&lt;/h3&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;We have also greatly enhanced message interpolation. You can now use the unified
      expression language inside your messages. This elegantly solves a lot of feature
      requests we had in this area like:&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the ability to put the validated value in the message&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the ability to format numbers, dates etc according to the locale&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      
      
      &lt;p&gt;Here is an example from &lt;code&gt;@DecimalMin&lt;/code&gt;. It uses the min boundary &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;, the
      &lt;code&gt;inclusive&lt;/code&gt; parameter in an EL and use a formaatter to display the erroneous
      value:&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;${formatter.format(&quot;%1$2f&quot;, validatedValue} is incorrect ; must be greater than ${inclusive == true ? 'or equal to ' : ''}{value}
      &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Which will be interpolated into&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;324.32 is incorrect ; must be greater than or equal to 500
      &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      
      &lt;h3&gt;Generic and cross-parameter constraints&lt;/h3&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Finally we have introduce the ability to make constraints both generic and
      cross-parameter aware. This is useful for constraints like &lt;code&gt;@ScriptAssert&lt;/code&gt; that
      are very flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;Review&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Please, please, please go and review the specification and tell us if something
      needs to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://beanvalidation.org/1.1/spec/1.1.0.beta3/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_content=spec&amp;amp;utm_campaign=1_1_beta3&quot;&gt;access the specification here&lt;/a&gt;.
      All changes are marked with a different
      color. &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#DDFFDD;&quot;&gt;Green for additions&lt;/span&gt;,
      &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#FFFFDD;&quot;&gt;yellow for changes&lt;/span&gt; and

    <title>Should getters be validated when they are called?</title>

      The expert group is agonizing on a specific issue. We need your
      feedback. Should getters be considered regular methods and thus be validated
      when called?
      
      The problem
      
      Existing applications put Bean Validation constraints on properties
      (ie getters). If we enable validations when getters are called, some
      applications might fail and Bean Validation would not be backward
      compatible. Besides, it is unlikely that you want to validate genuine getters
      when they are called. These are state, not operations for the most part.
      
      First off what does it mean to be a getter. A method is a getter if:

      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;its name starts with &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt;, has no parameter and its return type is &lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;or its name starts with &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; and has not parameter&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      
      
      &lt;p&gt;If in your service (say a CDI bean), you have an action method with
      no parameter and starting with &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt;, and if you have added constraints
      to validate the return value upon method call, we cannot differentiate
      this action method from a genuine getter.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;We have several solutions to work around the problem and we would like
      to know which one you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;We can use a few levers to work around the issue:&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;ask you to enable method validation explicitly&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;offer a coarse or fine grained solution to change the default behavior&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      
      
      &lt;h3&gt;Solution 1: enable method validation out of the box&lt;/h3&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;If method validation is enabled out of the box then the sensible default is
      to exclude getters from method validation.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;This approach is friendly out of the box and will work as expected most of
      the time (except for action methods with no parameter, starting with &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt;
      and with constraints on the return value).&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;The downside of this approach is that in this very specific case where
      an action method is also a getter, method validation would be disabled
      out of the box and a manual intervention would be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;You can change the default approach in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h4&gt;Solution 1.a: global flag&lt;/h4&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Use a global flag to disable method validation entirely or ask for getters
      to be validated upon call. You would use &lt;code&gt;validation.xml&lt;/code&gt; for that:&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;method-validation mode=&quot;INCLUDE_GETTERS&quot;/&amp;gt;
      &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;There is no way to change the behavior for a specific (set of) class.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h4&gt;Solution 1.b: fine grained flag&lt;/h4&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;An alternative solution is to change method validation behavior in a
      much more fine-grained approach:&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;set the default approach globally
      in &lt;code&gt;validation.xml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;set or override the setting for a given package (including sub-packages?)
      via &lt;code&gt;@ValidateOnCall&lt;/code&gt; as a package annotation (or &lt;code&gt;validation.xml&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;set or override the setting for a given class
      via &lt;code&gt;@ValidateOnCall&lt;/code&gt; as a type annotation (or &lt;code&gt;validation.xml&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;set or override the setting for a given method
      via &lt;code&gt;@ValidateOnCall&lt;/code&gt; as a method annotation (or &lt;code&gt;validation.xml&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      
      
      &lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;@ValidateOnCall&lt;/code&gt; annotation can be overridden in &lt;code&gt;validation.xml&lt;/code&gt; like we do for
      constraints declarations.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class AwesomeService {
          // not a getter - validated by default
          @NotNull Currency provideMainCurrency(@ISO @NotNull String country) { ... }
      
          // not a getter - validated by default
          @NotNull Currency getAlternativeCurrencies(@ISO @NotNull String country) { ... }
      
          // getter - must use @ValidateOnCall to activate
          @ValidateOnCall(mode=INCLUDE_GETTERS)
          @NotNull getAllCurrencies() { ... }
      }
      &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Note that, we could put &lt;code&gt;@ValidateOnCall(mode=INCLUDE_GETTERS)&lt;/code&gt; on the package
      of service classes&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@ValidateOnCall(mode=INCLUDE_GETTERS)
      package com.acme.gladiator.action;
      &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;In this case, &lt;code&gt;getAllCurrencies()&lt;/code&gt; does not need to be annotated with &lt;code&gt;@ValidateOnCall&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h3&gt;Solution 2: disable method validation out of the box&lt;/h3&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;In this situation, a user wanting to enable method validation needs to both:&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;add the constraints on methods&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;add the flag to enable method validation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      
      
      &lt;p&gt;The method validation flag would both allow it to be enabled and decide if getters
      should be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;This approach is the least surprise approach as nothing is happening that you
      have not explicitly asked for. The drawback is that it requires a manual intervention to enable
      method validation in a given archive which is not groovy.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h4&gt;Solution 2.a: global flag&lt;/h4&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;For all archives using method validation, a &lt;code&gt;META-INF/validation.xml&lt;/code&gt; file must
      be added. The file would contain the explicit setting:&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;method-validation mode=&quot;INCLUDE_GETTER&quot;/&amp;gt;
      &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;There is no way to change the behavior for a specific (set of) classes.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h4&gt;Solution 2.b: fine grained flag&lt;/h4&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;As described in the previous section, we could enable method validation at
      the package, class and method level using either a &lt;code&gt;@ValidateOnCall&lt;/code&gt; annotation
      or via the &lt;code&gt;validation.xml&lt;/code&gt;. In this approach, &lt;code&gt;validation.xml&lt;/code&gt; is not mandatory
      to enable method validation provided that you use &lt;code&gt;@ValidateOnCall&lt;/code&gt; in your code.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;So what's your favorite?&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;My personal favorite is to enable non-getter method validation out of the
      box and offer fine-grained options to override the behavior. That's solution
      1.b. My reasoning is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I want ease of use and method validation enabled by default&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;actions methods named like a getter, with no parameter and constraints
      on its return value will be rare - return value constraint are less common
      than parameter methods&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      
      
      &lt;p&gt;Some in the expert group do prefer solution 2.a or 2.b.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;What's your take? And why do you prefer this approach?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;h2&gt;What's new in this draft&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;A lot of work has been done to polish or rework the features introduced
      in the first draft. We have also added a few additional improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;improved integration with CDI: dependency injection, component
      lifecycle management and interception for method validation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;add rules describing method validation in particular how an interception
      technology ought to integrate: this will offer better portability&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;add support for cross parameter validators on method validation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;add metadata APIs to identify constrained methods&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;add support for group conversion (i.e., change the targeted group when
      cascading validation)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;clarify that composed constraints should fail fast when &lt;code&gt;@RepostAsSingleViolation&lt;/code&gt;
      is present&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;support &lt;code&gt;CharSequence&lt;/code&gt; (used to be &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;) for built-in constraints&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      
      
      &lt;h2&gt;Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;As usual, many thanks to the community for its feedback, the expert group for its
      work. Special thanks to Gunnar and Hardy who worked round the clock this past two
      weeks to integrate all planned improvements in the specification document.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fine control over method validation in Bean Validation... or not!</title>

      I need your feedback on whether or not you need fine controls on method
      validation.
      
      Some context
      
      Bean Validation 1.1 introduces the idea of method validation. When
      the method is called, parameters and return value can be validated.
      The constraints are of course defined as Bean Validation constraint
      annotations.
      
      I am working on the chapter describing how interceptor technologies like
      CDI, EJB, Spring, Guice, AspectJ should integrate it.
      
      We have decided to convert most of the
      recommendations into mandatory rules. In particular, methods annotated
      with constraints should be validated by the integration technology
      by default.
      
      Early in the design we have introduced an annotation @MethodValidated
      that lets you control a few things:

      &lt;p&gt;Early in the design we have introduced an annotation &lt;code&gt;@MethodValidated&lt;/code&gt;
      that lets you control a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;which group should be used for validation (defaulting to &lt;code&gt;Default&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;what part should be validated: parameters, return value, both or none&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      
      
      &lt;p&gt;This annotation made sense when validation was not on by default but I am
      now questioning its usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have a bunch of questions for you&lt;/strong&gt;. I tried to keep them short and to
      the point so feel free to answer them one by one. They also go from easy
      to more convoluted. Are you up for the challenge?&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Note that I have added a bonus question in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;What's your use case for disabling method validation?&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Why would you want to disable method validation on a given method or a
      given class?&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class UserService {
          @MethodValidated(validationMode=NONE)
          public void createUser(
              @NotEmpty @Email String email,
              @Valid Address address ) {
              ...
          }
      }
      &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;If you have a use case, would it be fulfilled with the &lt;code&gt;@MethodValidated&lt;/code&gt;
      annotation as described?&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;What's your use case for changing the default group?&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@MethodValidated(groups=Heavy.class)&lt;/code&gt; let's you change validation from
      the &lt;code&gt;Default&lt;/code&gt; group to the group of your choice - in this case &lt;code&gt;Heavy&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Provided that we will offer support for group translation when cascading
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://beanvalidation.org/proposals/BVAL-208/&quot;&gt;http://beanvalidation.org/proposals/BVAL-208/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class UserService {
          public void createUser(
              @NotEmpty @Email String email,
              @Valid @ConvertGroup(from=Default.class, to=BasicPostal.class)
              Address address ) {
              ...
          }
      }
      &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;do we really need the ability do decide which group to use to validate a
      given method? What would be the use case?&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;To me it seems that it could makes sense to validate one group over
      another based on:&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;some environmental consideration
      say a newbie user has more constraints on how it enters data
      than an advanced user hence different groups&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the caller
      say a branch of the code wants to apply different rules than
      an other&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      
      
      &lt;p&gt;In both case, it does not make sense to define the group via an
      annotation on the method to be validated.
      This would need to be a rather container specific behavior to let people
      inject the right group for the right context.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;When would you want to only validate parameters or return values?&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@MethodValidated.validationMode&lt;/code&gt; let's you validate both method
      parameters as well as return value, or either one of them or none at all.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@MethodValidated(validationMode=PARAMETERS)
      public class UserService {
          @Valid
          public User createUser(
              @NotEmpty @Email String email,
              @Valid Address address ) {
              ...
          }
      }
      &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Do you have a use case in mind for such need?&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;What inheritance rules make sense for &lt;code&gt;@MethodValidated&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Assuming we have &lt;code&gt;@MethodValidated&lt;/code&gt;, we need to define the overriding
      rules.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;We could decide that &lt;code&gt;@MethodValided&lt;/code&gt; must be placed on the method to be
      validated (no overriding rule), or we could try and add some or all of
      the following rules:&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;@MethodValidated&lt;/code&gt; definitions on a method overrides the ones on a class&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;@MethodValidated&lt;/code&gt; definition on a subclass overrides the ones on superclasses&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ol&gt;
      
      
      &lt;p&gt;Here is an example&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//example of rule 1
      @MethodValidated(validationMode=PARAMETERS)
      public class UserService {
          @MethodValidated(validationMode=BOTH)
          @Valid
          public User createUser(
              @NotEmpty @Email String email,
              @Valid Address address ) {
              ...
          }
      }
      &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Interfaces make things harder as there would be no magic rule to decide
      which definition has precedence over another in case of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;We could consider that methods of a class implementing an interface
      inherit the interface hosted &lt;code&gt;@MethodValidated&lt;/code&gt; definition (unless overridden).
      And in case two interfaces define the same method, overriding the
      &lt;code&gt;@MethodValidated&lt;/code&gt; definition would be mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;I can live with rule 1, I can support rule 2. but I feel that the rules
      related to interfaces make things quite complex and not especially
      readable. Plus I don't see why you would want to add &lt;code&gt;@MethodValidated&lt;/code&gt;
      on an interface. Not surprising as I don't see why one would do it on a
      class method anyways ;)&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;What do you make of that?&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;You are a convinced @MethodValidated fan? What about the name?&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;We have never found a good name for this annotation anyways. If you
      like and want this annotation, how should it be named?&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Yep that's the bonus question, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;I realize that it must look like I am having a &lt;code&gt;@MethodValidated&lt;/code&gt;
      mid-life crisis but better now than later :D&lt;/p&gt;

      Like most of you, the Bean Validation specification is coming back from holiday
      fresh and motivated.
      
      Java EE 7 is coming soon and to avoid missing the train, it is time to reap the fruits of all the discussions
      we have had over the last few months. I expect September and October to be focused
      on:
      
      
      integrating the various proposals in the speficication and flesh out
      the remaining problems
      taking decisions to unstuck discussions

      &lt;p&gt;The rest of the time will be focused on writing the reference implementation
      and the TCK and refine the various new features.
      We will also work with other expert groups to clarify the integration (CDI,
      JAX-RS, Java EE...).&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Our priority list is &lt;a href=&quot;http://beanvalidation.org/roadmap/#priorities&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the open. We will probably adjust it
      a bit but the main lines are now fixed. If you feel that something important is missing,
      come and help us identify it and build it.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;And remember, if you come later and complain about Bean Validation, we will ask you:

      Now that everybody is returning from their summer holidays, also the Bean Validation team
      is getting back to their desks in order to work with full steam towards revision 1.1.
      
      As you know, the largest new feature will be
      method validation, that is the validation
      of method parameters and return values using constraint annotations. Bean Validation 1.1
      early draft 1 lays the
      ground for this, and right now we're tackling some
      advanced questions still open in that area
      (btw. if you haven't yet tried out the
      reference implementation
      of ED1, this is the perfect time to do so and give us your feedback).

      &lt;p&gt;Now that everybody is returning from their summer holidays, also the Bean Validation team
      is getting back to their desks in order to work with full steam towards revision 1.1.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;As you know, the largest new feature will be
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://beanvalidation.org/1.1/spec/#d0e2147&quot;&gt;method validation&lt;/a&gt;, that is the validation
      of method parameters and return values using constraint annotations. Bean Validation 1.1
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://beanvalidation.org/news/2012/03/13/release-1-1-edr1/&quot;&gt;early draft 1&lt;/a&gt; lays the
      ground for this, and right now we're tackling some
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://hibernate.onjira.com/browse/BVAL-272&quot;&gt;advanced questions&lt;/a&gt; still open in that area
      (btw. if you haven't yet tried out the
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/FirstAlphaReleaseOfHibernateValidator5&quot;&gt;reference implementation&lt;/a&gt;
      of ED1, this is the perfect time to do so and give us your feedback).&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;One question the EG currently is &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/beanvalidation-dev/2012-August/000504.html&quot;&gt;discussing&lt;/a&gt;
      is whether and, if so, how a refinement of method constraints should be allowed in
      sub-types. That is, if a class implements a method of an interface or overrides a method
      from a super class, should the sub-type be allowed to place any additional constraints?&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;The current draft defines the following rules for such cases (see the
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://beanvalidation.org/1.1/spec/#d0e2429&quot;&gt;draft document&lt;/a&gt; for all the gory details):&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;No parameter constraints may be specified in addition to those constraints defined on
      the method in the interface or super class.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Return value constraints may be added in sub-types.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      
      
      &lt;h2&gt;The rationale&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;The rationale behind this is the principle of
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle&quot;&gt;behavioral sub-typing&lt;/a&gt;, which
      demands that wherever a given type &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; is used, it should be possible to replace &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; with
      a sub-type &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;. This means that a sub-type must not strengthen a method's
      preconditions (by adding parameter constraints), as this might cause client code working
      correctly against &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; to fail when working against &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;. A sub-type may also not weaken a
      method's postconditions. However, a sub-type may strengthen the method's postconditions
      (by adding return value constraints), as client code working against &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; still will work
      against &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;Can you show me some code, please?&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;To give you an example, the following shows a constraint declaration considered illegal as
      of the current draft, as parameter constraints are added to the &lt;code&gt;placeOrder()&lt;/code&gt; method in a
      sub-class of &lt;code&gt;OrderService&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class OrderService {
          void placeOrder(@NotNull String customerCode, @NotNull Item item, int quantity) { ... }
      }
      
      public class SimpleOrderService extends OrderService {
      
          @Override
          public void placeOrder(
              @Size(min=3, max=20) String customerCode,
              Item item,
              @Min(1) int quantity) { ... }
      }
      &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;While this approach works, follows principles of clean OO design and also
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/contracts/&quot;&gt;is employed&lt;/a&gt; by other
      &lt;em&gt;Programming by Contract&lt;/em&gt; solutions, some voices in the EG expressed doubts whether the
      handling of parameter constraints isn't too restrictive and thus may limit innovation in
      that area. In particular with respect to legacy code, the question was raised whether it
      shouldn't be allowed to add parameter constraints in sub-types.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;One example may be a legacy interface, which &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; has no constraints (that is, no
      parameter constraints are placed on its methods), but comes with a verbal description of
      preconditions in its documentation. In this case an implementor of that interface might
      wish to implement this contract by placing corresponding constraint annotations on the
      implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;An open question in this situation is what should the behavior be if the
      interface is being constrained afterwards?&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;Give use your feedback!&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;So what do you think, should such a refinement of parameter constraints be allowed or not?
      Possible alternatives:&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;allow such a refinement by default&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;have some sort of switch controlling the behavior (either standardized or provider-specific)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      
      
      &lt;p&gt;As there are pro's and con's of either approach, we'd very interested in user feedback on this.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Let us know what you think by posting a comment directly to this blog, shooting a message
      to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/beanvalidation-dev&quot;&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt; or
      participating in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doodle.com/qp78u6mqzetuas7p&quot;&gt;Doodle vote&lt;/a&gt;. Which use cases
      you have encountered come to mind where the possibility to refine parameter constraints
      may help you?&lt;/p&gt;

      After a long time in the shadows of open work... Ahem, take two. After a long time at work,
      I am very pleased to announce Bean Validation 1.1 early draft 1.
      This is our first big milestone since the release of 1.0.
      
      The draft is making its way through the official channels of the JCP but
      we also wanted to release it in full openned. For people in a hurry,
      the spec draft is here.
      
      What's new
      
      We worked on three major areas:
      
      
      openess
      method level validation
      dependency injection
      
      
      
      Openess
      
      The specification, the reference implementation, the TCK, this website... everything is open sourced.

      &lt;p&gt;The specification, the reference implementation, the TCK, this website... everything is open sourced.
      All work done on Bean Validation 1.1 is done in the open either on the mailing list, the issue tracker
      or via GitHub pull requests. Check out more in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://beanvalidation.org/contribute&quot;&gt;how to contribute section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h3&gt;Method-level validation&lt;/h3&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;You can now put constraints declarations on parameters and return values of methods and constructors.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@MethodValidated 
      public class OrderService {
      
          public OrderService(@NotNull CreditCardProcessor creditCardProcessor) {
              //...
          }
      
          public void placeOrder(
              @NotNull @Size(min=3, max=20) String customerCode,
              @NotNull @Valid Item item,
              @Min(1) int quantity) {
      
              //...
          }
      }
      &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Interception frameworks like CDI will check these constraints upon method calls thanks to the
      &lt;code&gt;@MethodValidated&lt;/code&gt; annotation. Read more in the spec.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h3&gt;Dependency injection&lt;/h3&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Bean Validation uses a few components &lt;code&gt;MessageInterpolator&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TraversableResolver&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ConstraintValidatorFactory&lt;/code&gt;
      and most importantly &lt;code&gt;ConstraintValidator&lt;/code&gt;. We have standardized how these objects are managed by a container
      and how these objects can benefit from container services.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;That means that your constraint validator implementation will be able to get resources injected automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;While we go into details on how it will fit in CDI and Java EE, we have worked hard to make it container
      agnostic. If you write or use other containers (Guice, Spring Framework, Avalon :) ), check out
      if it fits properly.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;We have had tremendous help from the Bean Validation community at large but I would
      like to give a massive thank you to &lt;a href=&quot;http://musingsofaprogrammingaddict.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Gunnar Morling&lt;/a&gt; who stepped
      up and lead the work on method-level validation. This is by far the biggest new
      feature of Bean Validation 1.1.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h2&gt;How to read the spec and provide feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;The draft has been published &lt;a href=&quot;http://beanvalidation.org/1.1/spec/1.0.0.alpha1/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_content=spec&amp;amp;utm_campaign=1_1_edr1&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and all changes are marked with a different
      color. &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#DDFFDD;&quot;&gt;Green for additions&lt;/span&gt;,
      &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#FFFFDD;&quot;&gt;yellow for changes&lt;/span&gt; and
      &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;background-color: #FFDDDD;&quot;&gt;struck through red for removals&lt;/span&gt;
      . This will help you see what has changed precisely.&lt;/p&gt;

      return values constraints, extensions to the Validator API, related additions to the meta-data API etc.
      
      So check out the proposal document and let us know what you think, e.g. by sending your questions or remarks to the

      The expert groups has begun its work on method-level validation. A feature that was drafted in the
      latest spec (appendix) but that we could nto finish in time.
      
      You will be able to define constraints on parameters and your favorite interception technology
      (CDI, @Inject, AspectJ, Spring etc) will call Bean Validation.
      
      The final approach is not fixed yet but it will look like this.
      
      public class BidManager {
          public void placeBid(&#64;Min(0) BigDecimal upTo) { ... }
      }
